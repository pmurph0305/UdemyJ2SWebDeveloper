Secure Shell is a protocol. An agreed upon way to communicate between machines.
Others:
HTTP, send files over internet between browsers and servers.
FTP, send files, used when you upload something to a generic upload site.
HTTPS, similar to HTTP but encrypted.
IMAP, send e-mails

SSH:
send files, control and modify remote computers over the internet.
encrypts all data so bad actors can't modify.

vs HTTPS: both communication & encrypted.
web browser uses HTTPS.
but a shell uses SSH protocol to exchange data between two devices.
