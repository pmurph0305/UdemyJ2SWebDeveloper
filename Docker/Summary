Summary
-----
Helps make sure the same version of services are installed in the right way on all computers of developers.
Helps ensure servers work regardless of where it runs.
Once environment is set up properly, the code can be shared and everyone will have it working properly.
Run distributed applications from anywhere with one simple command with docker-compose.

Without docker, the developers would have to install and run each service,
but now anyone joining a development team just needs to install docker and have everything set up.

With docker, can improve production builds. Wrap services in containers, and duplicate them, where small services can run in different locations.
All connected with eachother, but not having to worry about managing everything in one location.
