Docker
-----
As applications get bigger, the github project grows, more code is added.
It becomes difficult to manage & monitor the large amount of code.
A way to run app in all environments possible through containers.
Containers work together to make the whole system work.
Breaking down the app into small containers.


Before docker, we have VMs (vmware virtualbox etc.) Sandboxed environments that allow you to run virtualized instances of apps in a consistent and predictable manner.

Docker came and changed the idea. Containers wrap the software in a complete file system that contains everything it needs to run.
Garunteed that it will always run the same regardless of the env it runs in.
