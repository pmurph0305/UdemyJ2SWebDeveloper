Improving network performance.

2 obvious main things.

File minimization.
    - Minimize text. (html, css, javascript)
        - Can be done easily by using a minifier like UglifyJS. Usually part of a build process, ie through webpack.
    - Minimize images. (optimize images & smaller images)
        - Change file format to a small file format, super easy to do. 
        - JPEG: use for photos, images. but no transparency. Can be large in file size. Use for colorful images.
        - GIF: reducing color count leads to savings, but degrades image quality. Use for animations.
        - PNG: a lot smaller than JPEG generally. Can have transparency. Use for transparency.
        - SVG: vector graphics. Retains sharpness when scaling. Very small. Customizable through CSS. Generally simplistic images.
        There are other newer formats, but not completely supported.
        Want to pick best image format, and compress them without losing quality.

    - Image optimization:
        Reduce PNG with TinyPNG
        Reduce JPEG with JPEG-Optimizer (lower quality 30-60%)
        Resize image based on size it will be displayd.
        Use different sized images for different backgrounds.
            - Media queries.
                @media screen and (min-width: 900px) {
                    body {
                        background: url(imageurl.jpg) no-repeat center center fixed;
                        background-size: cover
                    }
                }
                @media screen and (max-width: 500px) {
                    body {
                        background: url(imageurlsmaller.jpg) ... etc.
                    }
                }

        CDNs like imigx.
        Remove image metadata.

    - Means less data needs to be transfered.

Minimizing delivery.
    - Reduce download frequency.
    - Reducing # of components requested, reduces # of http requests. Don't have to reduce content, just structure efficiently.
    - IE. Alternatives to massive UI frameworks. Lightweight libraries (seems more like file-minmization.)
    - Can combine CSS and JS files to reduce trips.
