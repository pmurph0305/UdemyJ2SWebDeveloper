Redis Overview
-----
Different databases are built to manage different things.
Lots of types of NoSql databases, document (mongodb), graph (neo4j), wide column (cassandra), key value store (redis).

Redis is a NoSql in-memory database. In memory, so really fast. Good for short lived data in applications.
In-memory, so bar for large datasets. Good for small pieces of data which allow us to keep it in memory / don't mind too much
if we lose some data / can return to a snapshot.

Redis is open source, used to built high perf scalable web apps.

One way to manage user sessions.

Going to add redis for user sessions to the smart brain app.
So users don't have to login every time they visit.
