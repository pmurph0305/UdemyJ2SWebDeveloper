5 major redis datatypes:

strings
    default when key value

hashes
    maps between string fields and string values.
    similar to javascript objects
    
lists
    implemented using linked lists.
    insertion is fast with lists.
    but searching is slower.

sets
    unordered collection of strings
    add/remove/test for existing members in a group
    not allowing repeated values/members.

sorted sets
    ordered collection of strings
    no repeating collection of strings.
    every member is associated with a score
    this score allows the set to be ordered
    from smallest to greatest.
