Testing Overview
-----
In real world, programs are very large, and worked on by many different people, with lots of code changes.
As the complexity increases, it becomes harder to fix bugs that may arise.
Adding features to one part of a site, may effect and cause bugs in other parts.


Enter testing.
Method in software development where individual units of code are tested to make sure they work properly.
Lots of new developers overlook testing as an important aspect of development.

A test is another file in the project ran in development, to make sure that the code works before release to production.
Although tests can slow down initially as you need to write more code, it's better in the long run to ensure functionality.



Final Note on Testing
-----
Tests are meant for development, they're never included in production code.
As writing code, something like Jest runs the tests as you work.
