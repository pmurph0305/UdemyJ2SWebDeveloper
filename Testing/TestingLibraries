Need Several things to do testing...

Testing Libraries: Provides the structural foundation for tests
Jasmine, Jest, Mocha.

Assertion Libraries: Provides functions that are assertion functions.
Jasmine, Jest, Chai.

Test Runner:
Jasmine, Jest, Mocha, Karma.js

Mocks, Spies and Stubs: 
Jasmine, Jest, Sinon.js
    Spies: provide information about functions
    Stubs: fake functions / replaces expected functions with behavior. Ie fake a server during a request.
    Mocks: fakes a behaviour to test different parts of process

Code Coverage: Shows % of statements functions etc which are covered with tests.
istanbul, jest


Puppeteer: A headless browser, used for various testing without having to use browser.
jsdom: in-javascript implementation of the DOM.


There are a lot of testing libraries, but they all have the same goal and function similarly.
create-react-app uses jest.

Unique tests to react testing: snapshot-testing, enzyme created by airbnb which allows us to write better tests for react components.
