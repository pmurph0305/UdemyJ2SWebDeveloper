Why typescript over other ways to add static typing to javascript? (ie flow, reasonml)
(He didn't explain at all after asking that question.)

Flow: static type checker. Adds types by writing code then putting through compiler. Depends on a compiler like babel to turn it into javascript
    "// @flow" at top of file so it knows to check types.

Typescript: different because it has it's own compiler. A superset of javascript. Adds functionality on top of javascript.
    Javascript is typescript, and typescript adds to it.
    Angular is built using typescript.

Elm: Similar to ReasonML, different language, has its own compiler to convert into JS.

ReasonML: Based on OCamel, a completely seperate language from javascript.
