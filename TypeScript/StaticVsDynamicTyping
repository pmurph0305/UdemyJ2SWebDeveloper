Dynamically typed language allows us to not say what type a variable is going to be.
Type checking is done during run time. So it doesn't know what type the variable will be until it is ran.

But in a statically typed language, you have to declare the type of the variable explicitly before using them.
Type checking is done during compile time.

Dynamic:
Pros:
    - more flexible / written faster.


Static:
Pros:
    - less bugs due to type checking at compile time. bugs caught early.
    - self documentation through declaration of types.
    - error on types at compile time

Cons:
    - code more complex due to declaring types.
    - Not a con: "Why cant you write better tests?"
    - Slower development process due to extra complexity / additional checks.


TypeScript allows us to make javascript behave like a statically typed language.

Mainly:

Strong:
    errors from type coercion.

Weak:
    type coercion, ie "hello" + 17 = "hello17"
