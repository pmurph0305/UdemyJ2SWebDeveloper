Helps with serverless architecture.
Tool used to help with AWS lamda.
Deploy AWS lamda functions from our commandline.
Don't have to use dashboard to config.


Isn't just for AWS, can be used with a ton of things.
Lots of templates available. We used aws-nodejs.
But also azure-nodejs and google-nodejs, (IBM) openwhisk-python etc.
Works with lots of service providers.


Connect serverless to AWS profile. (Enable IAM, programmatic access)
