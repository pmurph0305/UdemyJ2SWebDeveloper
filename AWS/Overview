Faster time to deployment.
Since on amazon services, ready for performance & scaling out of the gate.
More & more companies build partially or completely in the cloud with AWS.

On premise: had your own servers / machines


Why do we need this?
With a lot of connecting pieces. Lots of engineering time.
In dev can have everything on one container, in production need to be sure it can scale,
and different geo locations if users in dif parts of world. Manage databses & sharding.
Adding load balancers, etc.
With AWS they take care some of these points for us, load balancer, databases automatically scalable as users grow.
