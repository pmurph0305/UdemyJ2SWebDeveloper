Code Analysis
----
Most of the time, won't be starting on projects from the beginning.
You'll be working on a project that is already underway.

An important skill that is often overlooked is being able to analyze and understand how
the pieces of code, that you haven't ran or used before, fit together to form the whole.

Important to be able to get up and running on a pre-existing code base relatively quickly.
Recommended to get a higher level view before going into a lower level view.
Knowning the projects function and goals, and how the larger pieces fit together
helps to get up to speed faster with the project as a whole.
