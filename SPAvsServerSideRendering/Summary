SSRendering: great for static sites, faster initial page loads, better SEO.
but, does full page reloads which can cause slower page loads / increase in server requests / increased complexity of app.

Client side rendering:
good for rich interactions, faster interactions after initial load. good for web applications. but SEO can be difficult.


View painted in server side rendering is faster, so users can see the website and believe it's a faster experience even though
they cannot interact with the site yet.

A better way?
Progressive rendering?
Only get what you need, and progressively request more as it is needed.
