SSR React Libaries.
Gatsby
"blazing fast static site generator for react"
Great for static sites. React uses gatsby for it's docs.

Next.js
Great for dynamic / rich applications. Can build in next.js what you can do in normal React, but have it rendered server side.
Highly recommended by community. Many things included out of the box, code splitting, seo optimization, routing, etc..
Deploying next.js apps: now - realtime global deployments.
