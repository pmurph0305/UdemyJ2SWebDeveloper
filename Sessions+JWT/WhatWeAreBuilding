What we are building
-----
Token based auth

/signin username & password
generate JWT Token
send token back to browser & store.

then on future requests, ie profile/23, send JWT as part of request
server verifies & responds appropriately.



Cookie
/signing user & password
generate Cookie on server & stores it.
send cookie to browser
then user sends cookie to server, verifies stored cookie & response.



We're going to build and implementation of both of these methods.
Good flexibility & security, and learn both ways of doing things.

user name & pass checked by server,
then generate a token, sent back to user
saved by user, then anytime the user
access other info, send token back to server.
now instead of just verifying token, we're going to check redis database & check token strings on redis. (similar to how cookies are done)
then it will verify & repond properly.
