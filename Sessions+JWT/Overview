Sessions + JWT
----
Have to manage user sessions.
Make sure users stay signed in when refreshing pages.

Will have to build session management over and over and over again for many apps.

JWT = JSON Web Tokens

Have protected & unprotected routes.
Login -> Recieve token from sever -> Use token to access whatever they have rights to access & change.

Will gain knowledge on how to securely manage sessions.
