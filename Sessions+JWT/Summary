Summary
-----
Most apps have users/signin/sessions functionality.
Learned how to use sessions & JWT
Generate tokens on sign in, and store in redis database.
Redis is in-memory so it's very fast to store/retrieve session tokens.
Can use tokens to talk to other api endpoints of our server.


exercises:
include pet & age in table & allow users to update this as well.
implement tokens to register.
add signout functionaility where you revoke the tokens
bonus: reduce repeated code (like all the repeated fetch())
