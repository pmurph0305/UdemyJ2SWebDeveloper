Web pack introduction:
Bundles files into static assets.

Helpful resource to make configuring webpack easier: http://web.jakoblind.no/webpack-config/ 

Main ideas:
1. Entry
    - Where does webpack enter into the project. Usually index.js. Tell it where to enter so it can begin analyzing project & files.

2. Output
    - Where should webpack output bundles files. Usually a build folder.

3. Loaders
    - Tools that compile or transpile your code. Send in code, and it uses something like babel to tranpile into a different form.

4. Plugins
    - Vital roll in output. Can use different plugins depending on what you want output.
