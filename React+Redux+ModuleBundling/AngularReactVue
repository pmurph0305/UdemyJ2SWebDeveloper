State of Frontend Development.

Angular, React, Vue top 3 frontend frameworks.

All have a goal of managing front end with a lot of javascript.

Lots of articles out there that compare these tools. 

Libraries and frameworks however, are just tools. And each tool has their own use case.
Being flexible and being able to recognize that each tool has pros and cons is important.
Tools change and libraries evolve.
Need to be able to adapt to new tools, and identify which is best for certain projects.

React used in this course because it can be used to teach good javascript fundamentals.
Angular has specific ways of doing things that would make that more difficult in this course.
