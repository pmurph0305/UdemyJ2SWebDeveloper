Bundles/Combines files together so that we don't have to do it manually, to help maximize delivery.

create-react-app does this for us, using webpack.

Lots of options for bundling, webpack is most popular.

Parcel: zero configuration, can be good for small solo projects. Easy to pick up and learn.
Webpack: Tried and tested, usually set up at beginning of project by team lead. Can require a lot of configuration.
Rollup: good at tree-shaking, removing code that isn't needed. Good for rolling out own npm packages.

Keep in mind when you should use them. As create-react-app does this for us, just understand why they are useful.
Time better spent learning to code than learning configuration files.
