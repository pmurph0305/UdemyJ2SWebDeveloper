React Performance Optimizations
-----
Optimizing Code in React:

1. Check out performance tool. Add query string ?react_perf

Shows what components are updating and lots of information about what the components are doing.
Important to keep in mind it's running in development mode, so it's not the exact same speed as a production version.
But it is a good indicator of where to best focus for performance improvements.

Redux can help with reducing # of components that are updating by reducing top level state changes.

React-dev-tools in chrome helps show which parts are being rendered. Can enabled highlighting to show which parts are being redrawn.

why-did-you-update is a tool that can show avoidable re-renders in console.
