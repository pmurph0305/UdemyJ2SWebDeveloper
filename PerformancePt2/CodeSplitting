Code Splitting
-----
How to deliver javascript files in most efficient way.

Was common to bundle scripts into large files, which is used on all pages of the site.
However, files become very large as javascript code increases.
Why send code before the user needs it? Maybe they won't ever need parts of code.

Now often want to send multiple simultaneous requests. Javascript benefits from being in small chunks to prevent
locking up the main thread. Code splitting / progressive bootstrapping. Just send code needed for current route.
As they go to other areas of site, send other parts of code. Or while the site isn't busy, it can load up the other files.
Gives the browser less work to do.
Want to send a minimially functional page for the current route. As more resources arrives, can lazy load and unlock more features.
Lazy loading means loading after page becomes interactive.

Trade off with react:
Screen flash as loading javascript.

Quick note:
There are a couple of options.
1. Route based chunking, splitting js based on routes as in the example.
2. Component based chunking, splitting based on components being displayed. Ie don't need to load pop out side menu bar until its needed.

React docs show react-router(route based) and react loadable(component based) as code splitting examples.
