Optimizing code
-----
One of javascripts heaviest costs is the engine compile/parse/execution of the code. Luckily, web browsers let you use dev tools to
show this process. In chome, use performance tab to record performance.

Animations can cause a lot of performance problems. Especially during scrolling events / moving elements around.

Build & test on representative hardwire. Adopt a performance budget to keep an eye on the cost of code.

Most important:
Low time to first meaningful paint.
Low time to interactive.
