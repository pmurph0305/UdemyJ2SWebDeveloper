Injections
----
Most common attack technique.

Injecting code into another piece of code.
IE. SQL Injections
' or 1=1-- 
';DROP TABLE users; --

Any time a user has to enter something, injections are a typical attack.
inline script injection.
Injecting scripts through script tags. Can also be injected through an image tag with an onerror which is ran.


3 Main things to prevent:
Sanitize/validate input: Only allow user to input things of the exepected type. Make sure it is what they are inputting. If it's not, discard it.
    Generally performed using a white list (things that are allowed) or a black list (things that are not allowed)

Parametrize Queries/Prepared statements: Precompiles an SQL statement so all you need to supply are the parameters.
    Lots of good solutions for this already using object relational mappers.

Knex.js or other ORMS: provide prepared statements for you so you only need to supply parameters for the statements.
    Prevents things like dropping tables / other sql injection. It builds the actual statements/queries for us, we just provide the parameters.
