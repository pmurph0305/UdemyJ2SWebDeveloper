Logging
-----
All about getting info from the system about what is happening.
Want to gather info about how users are using the service/website/api
so that if something goes wrong / see something suspicious. Can use the logged data
to find the issue / fix any security problems.

Insufficient logging/monitoring allows attacks to attack systems without being detected.

Time to detect a breach when something went wrong is around 200 days. And typically detected by external parties.
Having good logging can help you detect and prevent issues quicker.

How?
Lots of options, but shown in this course:
npm install winston 
npm install Morgan   - http request logger for node.

If we only periodically monitor logs, we miss the problems.
The more info we have, the more difficult it can be to find data we're looking for.
Think about what info you need so you can detect security problems.
Keep logging away from the front end / users.
