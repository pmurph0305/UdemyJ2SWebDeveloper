Access Control / Access Rights
-----
Having resitrctions on what authenticated users are allowed to do or not.


Principal of least privilege
give only enough access that people can do their work.
Ie a server without cors, then anyone can access them.
only allow certain things/people to acccess server endpoints.
ie. only allow access from certain routes on a whitelist.
never give more privilege than you need to.
Gives less attack points.
