Data Management
-----

Make sure you always have backups somewhere safe, so you don't have 1 point of failure.
Limit sensitive data exposure. Encrypt data at rest / in transmission (sometimes at rest is not feasible)
Be selective of what data you Encrypt based on resources.
Use encryption for any user identifying sensitive data.

Password storage...
bcrypt, scrypt, Aragon2 
Any website with login like a password must have good encryption. Above libraries are tried & tested.



pgcrypto - encrypt a few columns on a postgres database. Ie encrypt billing address of users.
