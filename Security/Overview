Security
-----
We know we should have good security, but what does that mean?

Unlike performance where everyone benefits immediately and obviously, you don't see benefits of sercurity until you lose money.
If you make something secure, nothing happens, because that is the goal. But the value is more hidden when compared to something like performance.

We have a responsibility to build with security in mind as it can effect both the company and it's companies.
Security is an ever evolving field, as people find new ways to attack systems.

We're going to work efficiently. Solve 80% of the issues that puts you ahead of the curve security wise.
Hard to be 100% secure as it is constantly evolving, but you can have good security by following important guidelines.
