Code Secrets
-----
Things you want to hide, like an API key.
Might want to connect to a db, needing a pass and user which you want to hide.
Or simply, extra variables for dev purposes.

Environmental Variables
    ie in create-react-app:
        using .env file (REACT_APP_ prefix)
        REACT_APP_EXAMPLEVARIABLE = THIS_IS_AN_EXAMPLE

    or npm dotenv for process.env variables.    
    
Commit History
    never want to put up secret files onto github as they are public.
    always use a .gitignore file, or never allow api kets into commit history.
