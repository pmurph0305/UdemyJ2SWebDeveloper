HTTPS Everywhere
----
SSL/TLS Certificates.

HTTP is plain text, while HTTPS uses a tunnel that
encrypts the information between client and server.

NEVER send private user info through HTTP.

Not only about privacy, but also about users safety.


How do we get SSL/TLS Certs?

2 ways to get HTTPS on website.
1.
https://letsencrypt.org
Backed by large companies & trusted.
Gives you a certificate.
Used to have to buy certs from cert authorities.
Now? With this site, they are easier to set up and free of charge.
Great docs to get https set up on your site.


2.
cloudflare
Has a global network of servers that work as CDNs
By default, give you https.
Their network also helps with DDOS attacks.
