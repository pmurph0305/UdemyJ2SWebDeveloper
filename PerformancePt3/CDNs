Content Delivery Networks
-----
Helps with accelerating any website with caching files on servers around the world.
Cloudflare is a good CDN that does all the world for us. Just update our DNS and it'll do the work of serving from the nearest CDN for us.
Value of CDN proximity occurs after initial request, as first time around the edge/cdn server needs to get files from origin server. But then with caching, it can
respond to subsequent reqests itself on the edge/cdn server.

Good for high traffic loads,
helps block bots & spam just due to how they were designed by the people who made them
reduced bandwidth consumption,
sometimes also do load balancing between multiple servers,
very secure (https, protection from ddos)

Examples of CDNs:
Cloudflare, Amazon CloudFront, Microsoft Azure CDN are the most popular.

CDNs help reduce the latency between the request for a webpage, and the time for the page to load.
In all cases, it takes time based on physical distance between user and physical hosting location.
Usually not a straight distance either, generally hops between links.
Want to use CDNs that have servers around the world / the infrastucture set up.
