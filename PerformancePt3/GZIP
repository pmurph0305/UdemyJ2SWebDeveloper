GZIP
-----
Other than optimizing images, gzip probably the best way to optimize perf.
Simple to implement.
By default when compressing a file, it will have same file name, but with .gz and files will be significantly smaller.

Ie in express app, a compression package, and then use middleware with app.use(compression())
By default all modern browsers allow gzip.
Most websides will be served with gzip.
Can gzip pretty much everything sent from the server.
Altenrative by google: brotli (.br is generally better than gzip)
although, there is not 100% adoption across browsers for brotli yet.
