Load Balancing
-----
A way to balance multiple requests at the same time, and
distribute them to different services. This is something you want to do
as you have more users making more requests. Because eventually the server
will not be able to handle the load.

The load balancer will distribute the load between servers.


Client <---> Server
On most simple blog websites they have a server they handle for you.
Most hosts use appache http server, or nginx, which are especially good
at serving static content.
But since they are good at serving static files, we can use them as load balancers.
nginx can be between the server and the client, and it will
balance the load between servers.
Can also cache requests in nginx so it can simply return the cached files.
Increase complexity can be wasted resources without a lot of users.
But is good to implement a load balancer to ensure it can scale better.
Load balancers become faster than single servers with a lot of users.
Can also use CDNs to serve the static files, and send api requests through
a load balancer.
